1,1,"रावणः स्वर्गम् अगच्छत् (simple intransitive)

रामो रावणं हन्ति (simple transitive)
सीता रामेण रावणं घातयति (causative)","rāvaṇaḥ svargam agacchat (simple intransitive)
rāmo rāvaṇaṃ svargam agamayat (causative)
rāmo rāvaṇaṃ hanti (simple transitive)
sītā rāmeṇa rāvaṇaṃ ghātayati (causative)",,"Ravana went to heaven. (simple intransitive)
Rama caused Ravana to go to heaven OR Rama sent Ravana to heaven. (causative)
Rama kills Ravana (simple transitive)
Sita causes Ravana to be killed by Rama OR Sita causes Rama to kill  Ravana OR Sita kills Ravana through Rama OR Sita has Rama kill Ravana OR Sita gets Rama to kill Ravana etc. (causative)","रावणः स्वर्गम् अगच्छत् – rāvaṇaḥ svargam agacchat (Ravana went to heaven) (simple intransitive sentence) 
रामो रावणं स्वर्गम् अगमयत् - rāmo rāvaṇaṃ svargam agamayat (Rama caused Ravana to go to heaven OR Rama sent Ravana to heaven) 
This is equivalent to the transitive-causative pair in Hindi.

Note that Ravana which was the subject of the first (simple ) sentence becomes accusative in the causative.

This construction is taken by all intransitive verbs.
This is also taken by those those transitive verbs that imply any of the following categories of action: motion, knowledge, information and eating. (There are some exceptions to this like √bhakṣ √भक्ष् “eat”)

rāma odanam āśnat राम ओदनम् आश्नत् (Rama ate rice) – simple
sa rāmam odanam āśayat स रामम् ओदनम् आशयत् (He caused Rama to eat rice) – causative

Note here that even though the verb is transitive, since it implies eating,  in the causative, the agent caused to do the action is in the accusative.

* There are some roots like √kr̥ √कृ and √hr̥ √हृ that take either the accusative or the instrumental in the causative.

* Causative Passive: The agent caused to do the action is in the nominative (regardless of whether it is in the instrumental or the accusative in the active). The direct object in the primitive sentence remains in the accusative. The agent who causes the action to be done is in the instrumental (like normally in the passive).

rāmo rāvaṇaṃ hanti रामो रावणं हन्ति – Rama kills Ravana (simple transitive sentence)
rāmo rāvaṇaṃ ghātyate रामो रावणं घात्यते – Rama is caused to kill Ravana (causative passive)
sītayā rāmo rāvaṇaṃ ghātyate सीतया रामो रावणं घात्यते – Rama is caused to kill Ravana by Sita

* Roots of the tenth class (whose class sign is -aya- -अय- ) have the same primitive and causative forms. So, corayati चोरयति can mean “he steals” or “he causes to steal”

* For many roots, the causative passive and primitive passive may be the same. For example, gamyate गम्यते can mean “it is gone” or “he is caused to go”.","Formation of the causative

The causative is formed by adding an -aya- -अय- to a strengthened root. It is then conjugated in the active and middle like a thematic verb ",
1,2,"मैंने उससे कुर्सी ठीक करवाई 
मैंने अपना चश्मा ठीक करवाया 
मैंने उससे कुछ खाना पकवाया 


","maiṁnē usasē kursī ṭhīka karavāī
maiṁnē apanā caśmā ṭhīka karavāyā
maiṁnē usasē kucha khānā pakavāyā",,"I had him fix the chair.
I had my eyeglasses fixed.
I had him cook some food",,"Hindi प्रयोजक verb formation shows progression from intransitive to transitive to causative. Hindi often indicates transitive and causative verbs with distinct morphemes (आ and वा), or else with certain morphological changes (changes to the vowels or consonants of the intransitive verb stem). Note how the transitive verb stem appends the morpheme आ and the causative verb stem appends the morpheme वा.  This is the most basic pattern of transitive and causative verbs. Progression of Intransitive verbs to causative verbs:
Intransitive --Transitive--                     Causative
पकना to be cooked  ---  पकाना to cook (something) ---  पकवाना to cause to cook

Intransitive ---  First Causative ---                           Second Causative
सीखना to learn   --- सिखाना to teach (to cause to learn)-----सिखवाना to have someone teach
देखना to see ---- दिखाना to show (to cause to see)--- दिखवाना to have someone show
समझना to understand समझाना to explain (to cause to understand) समझवाना to have someone explain
सुनना to hear                     सुनाना to recite, to tell (to cause to hear)     सुनवाना to cause to recite
खाना to eat                     खिलाना to feed (to cause to eat)             खिलवाना to have someone feed
पीना to drink     पिलाना to give someone something to drink (to cause to drink)     पिलवाना to have someone give someone something to drink","Some important Syntactic clues
All transitive adjectival conjunct verbs (adjective + करना) have adjective + होना as their intransitive form. 
Likewise, all transitive nominal conjunct verbs (noun + करना) have noun + होना as their intransitive form. 
In the same manner, transitive causative conjunct verbs are formed as adjective/noun + करवाना/कराना.
All causative and transitive verbs are “ने verbs”.
With regard to syntax, the external agent, if mentioned, generally comes after the subject. If the subject has both direct and indirect objects, the agent may be mentioned before or after the indirect object."

Theoretically, the denominative verbs can have all tenses and
moods, though generally only the present tense forms, and a few
participial forms are found in literature.
Again, theoretically, a denominative verb such as पुत्रीयति can
have secondary formations such as causatives, desideratives,
intensives etc. Such formations, though theoretically possible,
and though discussed by Sanskrit grammarianst are almost nonexistent in actual known usag",,
