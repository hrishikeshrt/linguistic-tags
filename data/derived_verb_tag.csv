1,dv_01,prayojaka,प्रयोजक,Causative,"The causatives are the verbs that are used to indicate that one person causes another person to do something for the first person. 
Some important points regarding causatives are:
(1) With causative, an originally intransitive verb can become transitive.
(2) An originally transitive verb can become diwtransitive (with two objects) in causative.
(3) The causative of a tenth conjugation verb may be identical with the original in form, though different in meaning.
(4) One can have, in theory, numerous degrees of causativization, and yet the outward form remains the same."
